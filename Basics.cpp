Common ways to structure code:

-- Procedural Programming: The program moves through a linear series of instructions.
-- Functional Programming: The program moves from one function to another.
-- Object Oriented Programming: Use of Objects and Classes


What is Object Oriented Programming?

>> OOP is a programming pattern bassed on the concept of objects which can contain data in the form of
   fields/attributes/properties and code in the form of functions/ methods / procedures.
   (Every real life object has some properties and functionalities. We can represent it using OOP)

>> OOP can represent the real world more directly and precisely than previous paradigms, so the program becomes simpler and easier to understand.
>> Object-Oriented-Programing allows programmers to think of software development as if they are working with real-life entities.
   In your everyday life, people have the knowledge and can-do various works/tasks.
   
 
 Four main benefits of OOP
 1. Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. 
                 Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                 (helps in avoiding duplication for example if we have to represent 4 different cars)
